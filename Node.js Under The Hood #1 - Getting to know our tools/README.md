## NodeJS history

Node.JS was released in May 27, 2009 and it is 13 year old by the time of this and it was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl">Ryan Dahl</a> which was later sponsored by Joyent. At first, Node.js supported only Mac OS X and Linux

On November 8, 2009 at the inaugural European JSConf, the Node.js project was first demonstrated by Dahl. Node.js is a combination the V8 JavaScript Chrome engine, a low-level I/O API, and an event loop.
