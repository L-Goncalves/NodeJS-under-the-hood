## NodeJS history

Node.JS was released in May 27, 2009 and it is 13 year old by the time of this and it was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl">Ryan Dahl</a> which was later sponsored by Joyent. At first, Node.js supported only Mac OS X and Linux

On November 8, 2009 at the inaugural European JSConf, the Node.js project was first demonstrated by Dahl. Node.js is a combination the V8 JavaScript Chrome engine, a low-level I/O API, and an event loop.

Node.JS happened to be built at the right time, it introduces a lot of innovative thinking and allows Javascript to run on the server-side.

## Ok but what is NodeJS?
<p><b>Node.js</b> is defined by Ryan Dahl is a set o libraries that run on top of V8 engine that allows us to run Javascript on the Server-side, basically it lets us run JS outside the browser</p>

## Brief history of Javascript
Javascript First appeared in December 4, 1995 and it was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days. The first name of Javascript was originally named Mocha but after a while It became known as Livescript and later Javascript.

### What is Javascript 
Javascript is a scripting language that is one of the three cores used to develop websites. Javascript lets you add functionality to your website allowing the people that visit the website interact with the content.

Javascript is primarily a client-side language, which means it runs on the front-end primarily. However nowadays it's possible to execute on the server-side with NodeJS.

### ECMAScript was born.
In 1997 Javascript was growing really fast, it became clear that the language would need to be maintained and managed. So Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA).


### Difference between Javascript and Java
<ul>
    <li>Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.</li>
    <li>Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is primarily on a browser only.</li>
    <li>Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.</li>
    <li>They require different plug-ins.</li>
</ul>
